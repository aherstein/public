FetchJobPostingsController is the Laravel controller which handles fetching posts from the Reddit API via the RedditApi
class and stores them in the local database using Laravel's built-in ORM framework.

RedditApi is the class that makes the calls to the Reddit API. It has the logic to parse the JSON data returned from the
RESTful call and translate it into a form the rest of the application can understand using the JobPosting model.

Curl is a helper class that encapsulates the curl commands used by various parts of the application, including RedditApi.
